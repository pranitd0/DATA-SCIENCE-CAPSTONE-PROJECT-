SpaceX Launch Analysis & Prediction
🚀 SpaceX Launch Analysis & Prediction — IBM Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains my complete IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project, where I analyzed SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to determine the factors that influence the success of first-stage landings and built a machine learning model to predict landing outcomes.

SpaceX’s ability to land and reuse the Falcon 9 booster is one of the biggest cost-saving achievements in aerospace.
The goal of this project is to explore what makes a launch successful, visualize launch patterns, build an interactive dashboard, and develop an ML model that predicts launch success with real-world data.

📂 Project Workflow

This project follows a full end-to-end Data Science pipeline:

1️⃣ Data Collection (API + Web Scraping)

Collected launch data from the SpaceX REST API

Scraped additional data such as launch details, booster version, and payload mass

Combined, cleaned, and standardized datasets for analysis

2️⃣ Data Wrangling

Handle missing values

Convert datatypes

Feature engineering for booster categories

Normalize payload features

Cleaned and prepared the dataset for EDA and ML

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA using:

Matplotlib / Seaborn

SQL Queries

Interactive Folium Maps

Key insights include:

Launch success rate across different sites

Relationship between payload mass and success

Booster version impact on performance

Geographical launch patterns

4️⃣ Interactive Dash Application (Plotly Dash)

Developed a full web dashboard with:

Success counts per site (Pie Chart)

Payload vs Success correlation (Scatter Plot)

Launch site filter

Payload slider filter

This dashboard helps visualize launch performance dynamically.

5️⃣ Machine Learning & Prediction

Built ML models to predict Falcon 9 first-stage landing success:

Algorithms used:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Models were evaluated using:

Accuracy Score

F1-Score

Jaccard Index

Confusion Matrix

The best-performing model can be used to predict future landing outcomes based on payload, booster type, and launch site.
